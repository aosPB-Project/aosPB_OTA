# Becoming a maintainer for aosPB-Project:

Before you apply to add your device to our list of official devices, you must meet certain requirements in order to be considered:

**Note:** Failure to meet the requirements given below will disqualify you from maintainership

**1** - You **MUST** own the device you are applying for. Blind and untested builds are not allowed. You may maintain devices with minimal hardware differences from your own, as long as you also maintain your device too and have the builds for the "similar device" tested as required.

**2** - Your code **MUST** comply with the established Code Of Conduct and meet all specified Device Requirements. Adherence to these standards is essential to ensure consistency, quality, and compatibility within our platform.

**3** - You **MUST** have a basic knowledge of Git.

**4** - You **MUST** create an unofficial build that is fully functional (maintaing it for some time is also considered).
Ensure that the build is stable for daily use before applying. The context of stability may differ for different devices, so explain any exceptions.

**5** - You **MUST** have your device sources for the ROM available publicly with proper authorship for each commit. A coherent commit history that demonstrates your knowledge of Git and shows changes in an organized manner should also be present.

**6** - You **MUST NOT** include any stolen ('kanged') commits without crediting the original author.

**7** - You **MUST NOT** lie on the maintainer application, any attempt to mislead us (regarding form, sources etc..) will lead to immediate rejection.

**8** - You **SHOULD NOT** maintain too many ROMs. Doing so may dilute your time and efforts, potentially compromising the maintenance quality of the ROMs you are responsible for.

**9** - Your English proficiency **MUST** be at a communicative level.


After applying and once your application is acknowledged, you will receive a message from a member of the administration on the Github issue/application regarding the acceptance or rejection of the application.

**Thank you for taking the time to read aosPB-Project maintainers requirements. We appreciate your help in making our project better.**
